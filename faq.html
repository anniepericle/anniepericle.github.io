                        <h2><em>is this a good trip for kids? / what are the age ranges you allow?</em></h2>
                        <br>
                        <p>absolutely! this is a great trip for children of all ages. we have found, however, that children over the age of 8 seem to enjoy it more. the areas we are rafting through are some of the most beautiful in the world, and you never know what you might see around any corner, so children are always engaged.</p>

                        <h2><em>is whitewater rafting safe?</em></h2>
                        <br>
                        <p>as with all adventure sports, there is an inherent and assumed element of risk. to help ensure your safety, our guides are all certified in Wilderness First Aid and start with at least 3 years of rafting experience.
                            <p>the most common injury is a sunburn. everyone on commercial rafting trips wears coast guard approved life vests or personal flotation devices (PFD). your guide will give you an in-depth and engaging safety talk before your trip begins explaining what you should prepare for and do in the event that you fall out of the raft.</p>
