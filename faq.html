                    <li><em>is this a good trip for kids? / what are the age ranges you allow?</em>
                        <br> absolutely! this is a good trip for children of all ages. We have found, however, that children over the age of 8 seem to enjoy it more overall (and parents especially enjoy it more if their children are all over 8). the areas we are rafting through are some of the most beautiful in the world, and you never know what you might see around any corner, so children are always engaged.
                    </li>
                    <li><em>is whitewater rafting safe?</em>
                        <br> as with all adventure sports, there is an inherent and assumed element of risk. to help ensure your safety, our guides are all certified in Wilderness First aid and all start with at least 3 years of rafting experience. the most common injury is a sunburn. everyone on commercial rafting trips wears coast guard approved life vest or personal flotation device (PFD). your guide will give you an in depth and engaging safety talk before your trip begins explaining what you should prepare for and do in the event that you fall out of the raft.
                    </li>
                    <li><em>what is included in the trip?</em>
                        <br> we will provide all necessary camping equipment. this includes a sleeping bag, foam pad, waterproof duffle bag, small waterproof day bag, tent and a cot, eating utensils and camping chair.Â  we also provide water and lemonade during the day- and coffee, tea and hot chocolate during the morning and evening hours. you may bring beer, liquor and soft drinks (in reasonable amounts, 2 cans per day). 3 meals per day, plus snacks.
                    </li>
                    <li><em>what do I need to bring?</em>
                        <br> the most effective way to plan for temperature and weather changes in the Canyon is to be prepared for both hot and dry and cold and wet. rain jacket and rain pants quick dry clothing clothes to cover skin to protect from sunburn swimsuits hat with strap sunglasses with strap socks water shoes sleep wear water bottle, small day pack for hikes, moisturizing lotion, headlamp or flashlight, moleskin, waterproof sunscreen, and lip balm optional items: gloves, fleece jacket, towel, bandana, small pillow hygiene products: toothpaste, toothbrush, tissue, nail clippers, feminine hygiene products, extra eyeglasses or contacts, biodegradable soap and shampoo camera equipment book, watercolors, journal, and pen
                    </li>
                    <li><em>how far in advance should I book my trip?</em>
                        <br> if you have specific dates you need, we recommend booking a year in advance. if you can be more flexible 6 months in advance is usually sufficient.
